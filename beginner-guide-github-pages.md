## WHAT IS GITHUB PAGES?

GitHub Pages is a tool that lets you create a website directly from files you’ve stored in GitHub. You don’t need to pay for hosting, and there’s no need for a complicated setup.

It’s basically a simple way to put your projects online. If you have a GitHub account and know how to upload files, you can use GitHub Pages to make those files live on the web. This is great for things like portfolios, personal sites, or any other simple project you want to share with others.

We’re going to use GitHub Pages in this guide to take the files you create and turn them into an actual website that anyone can visit.

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED

Here’s a quick look at what you need to follow this guide:

- **A GitHub account**  
  Don’t worry if you don’t have one yet! We’ll guide you through creating a GitHub account step-by-step in the following section. You’ll be uploading your website here once you’re all set up.

- **A browser**  
  Most of what we’ll do happens online. Chrome, Firefox, or whatever you normally use is fine.

- **Your website files**  
  If you’re new to this, no problem! You’ll learn how to create a basic HTML file in the next steps. You can also add things like images or a bit of styling with CSS if you want. We’ll walk you through each part so you can follow along.

- **Somewhere to write your files**  
  A plain text editor will do. You can use Notepad, or if you prefer, something like Visual Studio Code. Nothing fancy needed—just something that lets you type and save files.


## GETTING STARTED: YOUR STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE

In this section, we’ll walk you through each step needed to set up your GitHub Pages website. Don’t worry if you’ve never done this before! By the end of this guide, you’ll have your own website up and running. Let’s dive in!


### CREATE YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT

First things first—you’ll need a GitHub account. That’s where your website will live.

Here’s the simple version:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click **Sign up** to GitHub.
